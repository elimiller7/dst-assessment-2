    "Collaborative filtering creates a user-item matrix with values corresponding to the users preferences. Next, using a chosen similarity metric, the similarities between users' preferences are used to give recommendations for each user. Each user will be given recommendations for items that they have not given feedback for, but have positive feedback from users similar to the chosen user. These recommendations may also be predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.1: Similarity\n",
    "There are different similarity measures that can be chosen. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures linear relation between two variables, and the cosine similarity measures the simialrirty between two vectors depending on the angle between them in a vector space. Similarity may also be referenced as the distance metric or correlation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two types of collaborative filtering techniques are model-based and memory-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.2: Memory-based Methods\n",
    "Memory-based collaborative filtering can be user-based or item-based. User-based techniques compute the similarities between users based on their implicit feedback for the same item. Then, the predicted rating or given feedback is calculated using weighted averages of the item's ratings given by similar users. The weights are the similarities of the other users with the chosen item. Item-based techniques work similalrly but use the similarity between items instead of the similarity between users. Both of these methods form a similarity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.3: Model-based Methods\n",
    "Model-based collaborative filtering can be a lot quicker than memory-based methods. An example of this is the singular value decomposition (SVD). These methods use the user-item matrix to find rules between items and uses these rules to give a list of recommendations. If data is sparse, then model-based methods are recommended to deal with this. More advanced model-based recommendation systems can use clustering, neural networks and elements of graph theory. The main drawback of model-based methods is that they are typically have a very high computational cost and may require a large amount of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular algorithm used for collaborative filtering, when the similarity matrix is sparse, is Alternating Least Squares (ALS) minimisation. Simply, this aims to estimate the entries of a matrix $M=UV^T$ when only a subset of these entries is observed. The algorithm minimises the squared error with the observed entries, when alternating in optimising $U$ and $V$. This would allow us to give predicted entries for items which a given user has not listened to yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.4: Pros & Cons\n",
    "Collaborative filtering can be used when data is difficult to analyse since it can use the imnplicit feedback. However, there are a few problems. Firstly, the cold-start problem - a new user has no data, hence, the system cannot make meaningful recommendations for them. Also, if data is sparse, then recommendations can be less accurate and many items may not be recommended at all. Finally, the method must be scalable in order to stay efficient. The basic collaborative filtering methods can struggle with this, but model-based methods like SVD can be used to give efficient and robust recommendations."

    "## 4: Conclusion\n",
    "We have investigated collaborative filtering through memory-based and model-based methods. First, we implemented simple user-based and item-based methods which were slow, but successfully gave recommendations. The item-based methods seem to run quicker than the user-based methods due to the structure of the data. We then implemented model-based methods - SVD and ALS - which were much more efficient than the previous memory-based methods, and allowed quick recommendations to be given.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these methods gave recommendations which ranged in quality and performance depending on the availability of data. Next, we used PySpark to implement ALS and this increased the computational efficiency significantly, allowing us to quickly give recommendations for all of the users. This feature would allow us to scale our recommendation methods to large datasets and would be vital in developing our music recommendation system, which could theoretically have millions of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as the most efficient method, we evaluated the performance of the PySpark ALS method use RMSE and found this to be very high, leading us to conclude that there is significant room for improvement in our recommendations. However, although our recommender system may not be as good as we would have liked, we have implemented a number of different collaborative filtering methods and seen the benefits of the scalability and efficiency of PySpark."
