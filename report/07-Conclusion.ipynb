    "We have explored the use of Variational Autoencoders as a means of creating a recommender system for music artists. To do this, we have refined our model by adjusting its hyperparameters and analysing its computational performance. Overall, we have seen that the model's hit rate and NDCG score are relatively low, but can be affected by optimising the use of batches, the activation function, and the number of layers in the VAE. The MSE was lower than that of the purely random generator, suggesting that our model was able to successfully capture some relationships in the latent space."

    "In section 5 we explored the use of Graph Neural Networks, particularly the LightGCN model, which was able to perform at a relatively high level, with recall around 0.27, and further predictions that were all similar, suggesting that the model successfully made links between similar artists. We also explored the use of GPU's in the model and how they would speed up the running of the model. Finally we looked at the resource usage of the model, mainly time requirements and GPU memory requirements."
