    "## 0: Introducing the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already laid out the basic idea of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the introduction, and as such we will instead introduce a useful variant, known as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). GCNs are the most prevelant and broadly applied model of GNNs, [1] which are able to leverage both the information of the nodes and their locality to make predictions [2]. They do this using a convolution layer, which merges the features of a node with those of its neighbours. The most common method of recommender systems used with GCNs is Collaborative Filtering, where user's past interactions and connections to other users is used to make predictions. The main way it does this is through learning latent features (or an embedding) for each user and item node. GCNs then update this embedding by propagating information across the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{e}_u^{(0)}$ denote the user embedding of user $u$, and $\\mathbf{e}_i^{(0)}$ the item embedding of item $i$. Then after $k$ layers of propagation, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{e}_u^{(k+1)} = \\sigma \\left( \\mathbf{W}_1 \\mathbf{e}_u^{(k)} + \\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{N}_u} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{N}_u||\\mathcal{N}_i|}} (\\mathbf{W}_1\\mathbf{e}_u^{(k)} + \\mathbf{W}_2(\\mathbf{e}_i^{(k)}\\odot \\mathbf{e}_u^{(k)}))\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and a similar equation for $\\mathbf{e}_i^{(k+1)}$ [3]. In this equation, $\\sigma$ is the nonlinear activation function (e.g. ReLU), $\\mathcal{N}_u$ denotes the set of items that are interacted with by user $u$, and similar for $\\mathcal{N}_i$ and item $i$. $\\mathbf{W}_1$ and $\\mathbf{W}_2$ are trainable weight matrices used to perform feature transformations in each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations represent the basic building block of most GCNs, however after recent investigations as published in paper [3], it was discovered that for recommendation systems in particular, both the activation function, $\\sigma$, and the feature transformation matrices, $\\mathbf{W}_1, \\mathbf{W}_2$, have little influence on the model and in fact make the predictions worse in some situations. As such a new model was suggested that stripped these parts for a much simpler propogation method:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{e}_u^{(k+1)} = \\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{N}_u} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{N}_u||\\mathcal{N}_i|}} \\mathbf{e}_i^{(k)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{e}_i^{(k+1)} = \\sum_{u\\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{N}_i||\\mathcal{N}_u|}} \\mathbf{e}_u^{(k)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is known as LightGCN, and was shown to perform better in most cases than the other prevalent GCN and GNN models for recommendation systems. This goes to show that more complicated is not always better, which carries over to data at scale. Sometimes one of the best ways to deal with big data is to make sure your model isn't performing unnecessary calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGCN is still among the best models for collaborative filtering in recommender systems, and as such is the one that we will consider here."

In this section, for our dataset, we will look at the goal of predicting whether or not a user will like an artist. To achieve this, we will create an 80-20 training-testing split of the data. We have seen that for most users, the `user_artist` dataset contains their top 50 artists, so we will take 40 of them for each user at random, and isolate the other 10 to use as testing data. We will then train a GNN on the 40 artists in the training dataset, and evaluate the model by seeing how it predicts if the user will like the 10 artists in the testing data. If the model performs well on this target, then we could use the model to predict whether or not a user will like an artist not contained in their 50 artists."

    "We see that even just for 10 epochs, the model takes a very long time to train (around 75 seconds in our tests). This is because we are running it on the device's CPU. When it comes to machine learning, and especially for big datasets, running the model on the CPU is usually very slow and not ideal. Instead a GPU is often used since GPUs are designed to perform many parallel operations, which is very useful for training neural network models on large datasets. PyTorch and other frameworks for neural networks have this feature built in, and with the help of the CUDA platform we can efficiently use a GPU to run the models if one is available. CUDA is a platform published by NVIDIA which allows for general-purpose processing on their GPUs [5,6]. This section will use CUDA 12.4 to run the model on a NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti GPU:"

    "\n",
    "* The number of layers: `--layer`. In a GCN the number of layers represents how far we want information to propagate across the graph. 1 layer means that a node will only receive information from its direct neighbours, whilst 2 layers would provide information from a node's neighbour's neighbours as well, and so on.\n",
    "* The embedding size of the nodes: `--recdim`. This represents the number of features each node embedding has, essentially dictating the capacity of information that each node can hold.\n",
    "* The learning rate: `--lr`, i.e. how much the model is adjusted with respect to the loss function during training. A high learning rate might make the model converge quickly to a solution, but this solution may not be optimal. A lower learning rate means the model might take a long time or get stuck in a local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better investigate tuning these parameters, we write a function to allow us to easily run the model whilst changing parameters, e.g. in a for loop. We do this by using the IPython module, which lets you run line magic from a string, which we can thus format:"

This is because the `precision@k` is heavily limited by our `--topks` value. Since we have set `k = 20`, the maximum precision we can reach for a user is 50%, which happens if all 10 testing artists appear in the top 20 predictions. This number is even lower for those users which did not have 50 artists to begin with. On the other hand, `recall@k` just measures what percentage of the testing artists appear in the top 20 predictions, and so is not reliant on how many test artists each user had. `ndcg@k` is a useful metric but since we have not ranked the test artists it is less useful for us.\n",

    "We have considered the use of the LightGCN model for creating recommendation systems, achieving a maximum recall of around 0.27 on our test set after tuning the model. Looking further at recommended artists, we have seen that the system does seem to recommend similar artists that we do not have user listening data for, suggesting that it the model is able to effectively generate new suggestions for the user. We have also looked at the computational and time complexity of the model, and explored the use of GPUs to increase model training and prediction times."
