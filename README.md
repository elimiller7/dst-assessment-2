# Data Science Toolbox Assessed Coursework 2: Data at Scale

## Plan
- EDA / Intro
- Q1: Can we predict if a user will like a left out artist (to test model) / recommend further artists?
- Q2: How can different approaches to a recommender system affect the computational performance of our models?
- (time, space, etc.)
- Data: Split data into train, test, (validate) data --> leave some points for each user out?
- Collaborative Filtering
- Content-based Filtering
- Auto-encoders
- Graph-based methods
- Conclusion
- Put requirements in each .ipynb
