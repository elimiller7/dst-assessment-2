    "Hybrid filtering is the combination of different recommendation techniques, with the goal of giving more accurate and meaningful recommendations. This is a way to benefit from the elements of the different techniques and limit the effect of their drawbacks. One approach to do so is combining collaborative and content-based filtering. Weighted hybridisation optimises a hyperparameter which determines the contribution from each method. Switching hybridisation chooses which method to use according to a chosen decision rule which depends on the data. Finally, mixed hybridisation gives recommendations which have been given by each of the different methods separately."
